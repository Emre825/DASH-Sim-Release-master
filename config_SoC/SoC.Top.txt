# Configuration file of the Resources available in DASH-SoC
# Lines that start with "#" are comments

# Add a new resource using the keyword: add_new_resource
# Always add MEMORY last as a special resource, which will be used for communication 
# and does not support any functionality
# The following lines must have the attributes below
# The format: add_new_resource $resource_type (string)  $resource_name (string) $resource_id (int) $capacity (int) $num_of_supported_functionality (int) $DVFS_mode (string)
#             $functionality_name (string) $execution_time (float)
# Note: for type, use the following abbreviations
#       central processing unit --> CPU
#       Arm LITTLE cluster      --> LTL
#       Arm big cluster         --> BIG
#       accelerator             --> ACC
#       memory                  --> MEM
#
# opp $frequency (int - MHz) $voltage (int - mV), defines the Operating Performance Points (OPPs) with frequency and voltage tuples
#
# trip_freq $trip_1 $trip_2 $trip_3 ..., defines the frequencies that are set at each trip point if throttling is enabled. "-1" means that the frequency is not modified
#
# power_profile $frequency $power_1 $power_2 $power_3 ... $power_max_capacity
# e.g., power_profile 1000 0.19 0.29 0.35 0.40. At 1GHz, the power for 1 core is 0.19W, 2 cores is 0.29W, and so on.
#
# PG_profile $frequency $power_1 $power_2 $power_3 ... $power_max_capacity
#
# Example: The following lines add a new CPU with name=P1, ID=0, capacity=1 and
#          that can run 3 different tasks using "performance" DVFS mode

# After adding resources, use keyword comm_band to add communication bandwidth 
# between resources
# The format: comm_band $source_id (int) $destination_id (int) bandwidth (int)
# Example: The following line adds communication bandwidth between resource 0 (source)
#          and resource 1 (destination)
#                    
#          comm_band 0 1 5


# The following line add a new resource with type CPU, name P1, and ID 0 to the SoC.
# this resource can run one task at a time (capacity:1) and supports 10 tasks. Finally, its default DVFS mode is "performance"

# This resource does not throttle the frequency (hence -1 is given instead of throttle frequency values).
# For an example for DTPM throttling see: SoC.5APP_1.txt

# The following line speficifies the communication bandwidth between each resource as 100 units (MHz in this example).
# The communication time is found using this bandwidth and the communication volume specificed in the job config file.
# The units must be selected such that the ratio of the volume (e.g., bits) to communication bandwidth (e.g., Gbit/s)
# is consistent with the clock period (specified in config_file.ini). 
# For example, if the clock period is 1 ns, then the communication volume and bandwidth should be selected such that
# their ratio (hence, the communication time) is in ns. 
# The early examples used 1 us simulation clock. Hence, the volume was in bits and communication bandwith was in MHz (leading to us)
# Later examples started using 1 ns clock period. So, the bandwith has become GHz.
