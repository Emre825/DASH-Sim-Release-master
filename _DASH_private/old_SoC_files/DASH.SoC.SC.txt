# Configuration file of the Resources available in DASH-SoC
# Lines that start with "#" are comments

# Add a new resource using the keyword: add_new_resource
#   Always add MEMORY last as a special resource, which will be used for communication 
#   and does not support any functionality
# The the following one (or two) line(s) must have the attributes below
# if want to specify the capacity do it at the second line. if not include this line, the default value is 1
# The format: add_new_resource $resource_type (string) $resource_id (int) $num_of_supported_functionality (int)
#             capacity $capacity (int) 
#             $functionality_name (string) $execution_time (float) $power_consumption (float)
#
# Example: The following lines add a new CPU with ID=0, that can run 3 different tasks and
#          the capacity is 1           
#          
#          add_new_resource CPU 0 3
#          capacity 1
#          scrambler 12 14
#          reed_solomon_encoder 15 16
#          bpsk_modulation 18 30
#
# After adding resources, use keyword comm_band to add communication bandwidth 
# between resources
# The format: comm_band $source_id (int) $destination_id (int) bandwidth (int)
# Example: The following line adds communication bandwidth between resource 0 (source)
#          and resource 1 (destination)
#                    
#          comm_band 0 1 5
