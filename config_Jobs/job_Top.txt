# Configuration file of the Tasks
# Lines that start with "#" are comments
# Start adding task using the keyword: add_new_tasks
# The the following three lines must have the attributes below
# $task_name (string) $task_id (int) $task_predecessors (list)
# $task_name (string) HEAD (TAIL), if the task is the head or tail of the task graph
# $task_name (string) $earliest_start (int) $deadline (int)
# The format: add_new_tasks $num_of_tasks (int)
#             $task_name (string) $task_id (int) $task_predecessors (list)
#             $task_name (string) HEAD (string)  
#             $task_name (string) $earliest_start (int) $deadline (int)
# Example: The following lines add a new task with ID=0, and
#          predecessor for this task is task with ID=2
#          (empty list means there is no dependency)
#          This task is the head of the task graph
#          earliest start time and deadline are 0 and 10, respectively
#
#          add_new_tasks 1
#          scrambler 0 2
#          scrambler HEAD
#          scrambler earliest_start 0 deadline 10
#
# After adding tasks, use keyword comm_vol to add communication volume for
# the tasks that have dependencies 
# The format: comm_vol $source_id (int) $destination_id (int) volume (int)
# Example: The following line adds communication volume between task 0 (source)
#          and task 1 (destination)
#                    
#          comm_vol 0 1 5

# The following line starts a new DAG (called Top) to describe one frame of the target application (referred to as a "job")
job_name Top

# The following line specifies the number of task that comprise this job (the number of nodes in the DAG) as 10
add_new_tasks 10

# The following line speficies the ID of the first task (Task 0). No other number succeeds the ID since it does not have any dependencies.
task_1 0

# The following line specifies that task_1 is the HEAD node of the DAG (hence no dependencies)
task_1 HEAD

# The following line specifies the earlies time task_1 can start and its deadline. 
# It also specifies the incoming (input_vol) and outgoing (output_vol) data volume. 
# Since the output volume to each successor can be different, we will set this as zero and use "comm_vol" keyword after defining the tasks.
task_1 earliest_start 0 deadline 2 input_vol 0 output_vol 0

# The following line speficies task_2's ID (1) and predecessor (0). The rest of the lines follow the same format
task_2 1 0
task_2 earliest_start 0 deadline 3 input_vol 0 output_vol 0
task_3 2 0
task_3 earliest_start 0 deadline 4 input_vol 0 output_vol 0
task_4 3 0
task_4 earliest_start 0 deadline 2 input_vol 0 output_vol 0
task_5 4 0
task_5 earliest_start 0 deadline 3 input_vol 0 output_vol 0
task_6 5 0
task_6 earliest_start 0 deadline 3 input_vol 0 output_vol 0
task_7 6 2
task_7 earliest_start 0 deadline 3 input_vol 0 output_vol 0
task_8 7 1 3 5
task_8 earliest_start 0 deadline 3 input_vol 0 output_vol 0
task_9 8 1 3 4
task_9 earliest_start 0 deadline 3 input_vol 0 output_vol 0
task_10 9 6 7 8

# The following line specifies that task_10 is the TAIL node (it has no successors)
task_10 TAIL
task_10 earliest_start 0 deadline 3 input_vol 0 output_vol 0

# The following line specifies the communication volume between node 0 and node 1 as 18 units.
# The communication time is using this volume and the communication bandwidth specificed in the SoC config file.
# The units must be selected such that the ratio of the volume (e.g., bits) to communication bandwidth (e.g., Gbit/s)
# is consistent with the clock period (specified in config_file.ini). 
# For example, if the clock period is 1 ns, then the communication volume and bandwidth should be selected such that
# their ratio (hence, the communication time) is in ns. 
# The early examples used 1 us simulation clock. Hence, the volume was in bits and communication bandwith was in MHz (leading to us)
# Later examples started using 1 ns clock period. So, the bandwith has become GHz.
comm_vol 0 1 18

# The following line specifies the communication volume between node 0 and node 2 as 12 units.
